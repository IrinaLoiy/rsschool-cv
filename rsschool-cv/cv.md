About me
===========
I do not have a specialized higher education in this profession. In her specialty, she completed offline courses at the ***TeachMeSkills*** school (8 months) and defended her diploma. I also continue to study and deepen my knowledge with additional courses and lessons. At the moment, for repetition and deepening, I took the course of Vladilen Minin (Result School) on HTML & CSS.
Now I am actively delving into JS and the basics of React. I am studying at RSS School.
I have a non-profile legal education at the Belarusian State University.
My level of English is Intermedia.
 
During my studies on courses and self-study, I developed (perhaps too loudly said, but still) about 7 projects of varying complexity. They can be found [on my Git.](https://github.com/IrinaLoiy/IrinaLoiy.git)

**Soft-skills:**
* Friendly and always drown for a friendly atmosphere in the team - Great sense of humor (in my humble opinion)
* Communicative and very fast learner
* Very diligent, hardworking and persistent
